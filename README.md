AOTG is a basic shooter game, where the user controls a spaceship that tries to kill invading germs
in a patients body. The game allows the user to use all 2D space movements in addition to shooting
weapons that kill the germs. User respawns after being infected(touched) by germ (Life feature will be added on final)

Scoring: Different germs give the user different levels of points from 15pts to 100. Germs also
get points when they touch the user they get points, at the end of the day, the user should end up with
more points than the germs
